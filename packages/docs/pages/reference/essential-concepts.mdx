# How PreTeXt works

## Definitions: Tags and Attributes

PreTeXt is a **markup language** much like HTML. When creating content in PreTeXt, you are essentially working with two types of data objects:

-   **Tags** - also referred to as _elements_, tags are keywords between angle brackes, e.g. `<title>...</title>`. They can have further
    content within them, or they can be self-closing, e.g. `<emdash />`.
-   **Attributes** - provide information necessary to refine or specify the desired behavior for a tag. For example,
    to have an unordered list with square bullet points, you could write
    `<ul marker="square">...</ul>`. In this case, `marker="square"` is an _attribute_ of the `<ul>` tag.

A simple example of a PreTeXt document may look like:

```ptx
<pretext>
    <article>
        <section>
            <title xml:id="definitions">Definitions</title>
            <p>PreTeXt is a markup language.</p>
        </section>
    </article>
</pretext>
```

The [PreTeXt Guide](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/guide-toc.html) has a full introduction to PreTeXt and its concepts.
