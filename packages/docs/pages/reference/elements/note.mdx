# `<note>`

`<note>` is a [`<remark>`](./remark)-like tag
and so shares the attributes and structure with other remark-like tags.
In particular, the `<note>` tag creates a container to state something about which
the reader should take note with optional [`<title>`](./title) and [`<idx>`](./idx).

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="note" />

## Examples

 ```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="section subsection">
 <note>
    <title>Maps out of quotients</title>
    <p>
        In almost any algebraic context, you should never try to a define a map
        directly whose domain is a quotient, rather try to find a natural way
        to invoke the first isomorphism theorem.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example if <m>V,W</m> are vector spaces and <m>U</m> is a subspace
    of <m>V</m>, rather than try to define a map <m>T:V/U \to W</m>,
    try instead to define a map <m>T_0:V\to W</m> whose kernel is <m>U</m>
    and image is the same as that of <m>T</m>.
    It is easier than you think and always well-defined.
