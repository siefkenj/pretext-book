# `<cell>`

The `<cell>` tag is used to define entries in a [`<row>`](row) which itself is
contained in a [`<tabular>`](tabular) environment. Each `<cell>` has options to
modify its bottom and right borders, horizontal alignment of the contents of
that cell, or indicate via the `colspan` option how many columns in the given row that cell should occupy.

Horizontal alignment can be adjusted on a per-cell basis, but usually one
defines alignment for [`<col>`](col) tags, instead.  Vertical alignment can only be adjusted at the level of a [`<row>`](row) or the entire
[`<tabular>`](tabular) level.

Examples from the [`<tabular>`](tabular) or [`<table>`](table) tags demonstrate
most of the variations which are available.
