# `<flat>`

The self-closing `<flat/>` tag displays the flat symbol in music notation. 

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="flat" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    <p>
    In the context of music, the flat symbol (<flat/>) can be used to specify key signatures
    or to modify a single note.  It lowers the pitch (of a note) by one semitone. 
    </p>
     
    <p> 
    This contrasts with the sharp symbol (<sharp/>) which raises the pitch by one semitone, thus
    B<flat/> has the same pitch as an A<sharp/>.
    </p>

    <p> In some settings, the flat is written as a superscript, such as
    <n pc="B" acc="flat" />, written <c>&lt;n pc="B" acc="flat" /&gt;</c>.
    </p>
