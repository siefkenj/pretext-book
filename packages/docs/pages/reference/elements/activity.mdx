# `<activity>`

The `<activity>` tag, together with [`<project>`](./project.mdx), [`<exploration>`](./exploration.mdx), 
and [`<investigation>`](./investigation.mdx), are called PROJECT-like tags.  They are meant to contain
material for readers to do as part of their learning.  PROJECT-like tags share many features and structure
 with [EXAMPLE-like](./example.mdx) and [`<exercise>`](./exercise.mdx) tags; however the connotation of 
 their contents is different, and the visibility of components and the knowling behavior are controlled separately for each 
 of the three categories.  PROJECT-like are also on a different numbering system from other elements by default, 
 though that behavior can be changed. 

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="activity" />

## Examples

### An unstructured activity

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <activity><title>Differentiating polynomials</title>
        <p>
            Find the derivative of the functions
            <m>f(x) = 3x^5-7x+5</m> and <m>g(x) = 3x^5-7x+10</m>. What do you notice?
        </p>
    </activity>
</FRAGMENT>
```

### An activity can have a `<statement>`, and then an optional `<hint>`, `<answer>`, and/or `<solution>`.

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <activity><title>Differentiating polynomials</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find the derivative of the functions
                <m>f(x) = 3x^5-7x+5</m> and <m>g(x) = 3x^5-7x+10</m>.  What do you notice?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Remember to use the power rule, and that the derivative of a constant is 0.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <answer>
            <p>
                <m>f'(x) = 15x^4-7</m> and <m>g'(x) = 15x^4-7</m>
            </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We use the power, sum,
                and constant multiple rules and find that the derivative is 
                <md>
                    <mrow> f'(x) \amp = 5\cdot 3x^{5-1}-1\cdot 7x^{1-1}+0</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = 15x-7 </mrow>
                </md>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution for <m>g'(x)</m> is the same, since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are 
                the same except for their constants, but the derivative of a constant is 0. 
            </p>
        </solution>
    </activity>
</FRAGMENT>
```

### An activity can also be structured with an `<introduction>`, `<conclusion>`, and some number of `<task>`, each of which has a `<statement>`, and then an optional `<hint>`, `<answer>`, and/or `<solution>`.

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <activity><title>A highly structured activity</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
            Here is where we describe what the reader will accomplish in the project.
            </p>
        </introduction>

        <task>
            <statement>
            <p>
                The first step to do.
            </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
            <p>
                A little hint.
            </p>
            </hint>
            <answer>
            <p>
                Just the answer.
            </p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
            <p>
                All the glorious details about how to do the first step.
            </p>
            </solution>
        </task>

        <task>
            <statement>
            <p>
                The second step to do.
                We'll be lazy and just include an answer.
            </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
            <p>
                Just the answer.
            </p>
            </answer>
        </task>

        <conclusion>
            <p>
            A little wrap up.
            </p>
        </conclusion>

    </activity>
</FRAGMENT>
