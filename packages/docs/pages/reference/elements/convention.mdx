# `<convention>`

`<convention>` is a [`<remark>`](./remark)-like tag
and so shares the attributes and structure with other remark-like tags.
In particular, the `<convention>` tag creates a container to state some
convention with optional [`<title>`](./title)
and [`<idx>`](./idx).

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="convention" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="section subsection">
<convention>
    <title>Optional</title>
    <p>
        For an arbitrary group <m>G</m>, we typically denote the operations
        multiplicatively, so for elements <m>a,b \in G</m>, we would write
        <m>a\cdot b</m> or <m>a^{-1}</m> for the the application of the group
        operation or the inverse of an element.  However, when a group is known
        to be abelian, the notation is often written additively,
        such as <m>a+b</m> or <m>-a</m>.
    </p>
</convention>
</FRAGMENT>
