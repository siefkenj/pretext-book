### An unstructured exercise within the section content

This exercise occurs within other content inside a division (a [`<paragraphs>`](./paragraphs)), so it appears as a **Checkpoint**.
It is unstructured as it itself contains only [`<p>`](./p) tags.

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <paragraphs>
        <p>You need exercise every day.</p>
        <exercise>
            <p>Do five pushups.</p>
            <p>Stretch for five minutes.</p>
        </exercise>
        <p>Live long and prosper.</p>
    </paragraphs>
</FRAGMENT>
```

## A structured exercises with in a list of exercises

This exercise occurs inside an [`<exercises>`](./exercises) tag, so it is rendered a list item.
It is structured to include a hint, solution, and answer.

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <exercises>
        <title>Review exercises</title>
        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m>:
                <me>9x - 2= 4x + 5</me></p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>Add or subtract terms from both sides so that terms with an <m>x</m>
                are on the left side and all other terms are on the right.</p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
                <p>First, combine the two terms that contain <m>x</m>.
                To do this, we subtract <m>4x</m> from both sides, obtaining.
                <me>5x - 2 = 5</me>.</p>
                <p>Next, we add <m>2</m> to both sides so only the term containing
                <m>x</m> remain on the left-hand side:
                <me>5x = 7</me>.</p>
                <p>Finally, divide both sides by <m>5</m> to get <m>x</m> by itself:
                <me>x = \frac{7}{5}</me>.</p>
            </solution>
            <answer>
                <p><m>x = \frac{7}{5}</m></p>
            </answer>
        </exercise>
    </exercises>
