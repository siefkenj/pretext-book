# `<col>`

The `<col>` tag is optionally used in a [`<tabular>`](tabular) environment. Its primary use is to define horizontal alignment within a column or to specify by percentage how much of the tabular environment the column should occupy.

If the `<col>` tag does appear, it must occur prior to any rows and must occur
exactly as many times as there will be columns.


## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="col" />

## Examples

Representative examples for the use of this tag are found in the examples for  the [`<tabular>`](tabular) and [`<table>`](table) tags.
