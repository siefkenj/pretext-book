# `<problem>`

The `<example>`, `problem`, and `question` tags are closely related and have
the same syntax.  The `title` element is optional but encouraged, and the
structure can contain `hint`s, `answer`s, and `solution`s (in that order).

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="problem" />

## Examples

 ```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
<problem>
  <title>Row and column spaces</title>
  <p>
  We know that the rank of a matrix <m>A</m> and of its row-reduced echelon
  form <m>R</m> is the same.  Determine if the row space and column space of
  <m>A</m> and <m>R</m> are always the same.
  </p>

  <hint>
    <p>
      Elementary row operations are invertible transformations of the rows of
      a matrix, not the columns.
    </p>
  </hint>
  <answer>
    <p>
      The row space of <m>A</m> and <m>R</m> are always the same.  The column
      spaces are generally not equal.
    </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      As in the hint, each elementary row operation is invertible showing the
      row spaces are identical.  If <m>A=R</m>, then the column spaces are
      obviously equal, but if
      <me>
        A = \begin{bmatrix}1\amp1\\1\amp 1\end{bmatrix}, \text{ then }
        R = \begin{bmatrix}1\amp1\\0\amp 0\end{bmatrix},
      </me>
      so the column spaces are different lines in <m>\mathbb R^2.</m>
    </p>
  </solution>
</problem>
</FRAGMENT>
