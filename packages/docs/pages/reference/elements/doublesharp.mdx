# `<doublesharp>`

The self-closing `<doublesharp/>` tag displays the doublesharp symbol in music notation.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="doublesharp" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    In the context of music, the doublesharp symbol (<doublesharp/>) is most often used as a natural modifying a single note, typically to sharpen a note which is already sharpened in the key signature. It raises the pitch (of a note) by two semitones, that is a whole tone (in Western music).  This contrasts with the doubleflat symbol (<doubleflat/>) which lowers the pitch by two semitones, thus
    A<doublesharp/> has the same pitch as a B: (A  -> A<sharp\>=B<flat\> -> B).
