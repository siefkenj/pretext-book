# `<doublesharp>`

The self-closing `<doubleflat/>` tag displays the doubleflat symbol in music notation.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="doublesharp" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    
    In the context of music, the doublesharp symbol (<doublesharp/>) can be used to modify a 
    single note.  It raises the pitch of the note by two semitones. Thus A<doublesharp/> has 
    the same pitch as a B. Often when a key signature already specifies a note be sharped, 
    the doublesharp simply indicates that it should be sharped beyond what is specified by 
    the key signature.
