# `<question>`

The `<example>`, `problem`, and `question` tags are closely related and have
the same syntax.  The `title` element is optional but encouraged, and the
structure can contain `hint`s, `answer`s, and `solution`s (in that order).

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="question" />

## Examples

 ```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">

  <title>Unions of vector subspaces</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
        Is the union of subspaces of a vector space always a vector space?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    <p>
      Examples are often the key to answering questions like this.
      Pick a nice vector space like <m>\mathbb R^2</m> or
      <m>\mathbb R^3</m> and play.
    </p>
  </hint>
  <answer>
    <p>
      No they are not.  For example, the <m>x</m>-axis and <m>y</m>-axis in
      <m>\mathbb R^2</m> are both subspaces, but their union is not since the
      union is not closed under addition:  <m>(0,1) + (1,0) = (1,1)</m>, and
      the vector <m>(1,1)</m> is not a member of either axis.
    </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Show that if <m>U,W</m> are subspaces of a vector space <m>V</m>,
      then <m>U\cup W</m> is a subspace if and only if
      <m>U\subseteq W</m> or <m>W\subseteq U.</m>
    </p>
  </solution>
