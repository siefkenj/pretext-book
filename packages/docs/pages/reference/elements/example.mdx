# `<example>`

The `<example>` tag creates a container for the presentation of an example.
The [`<title>`](.title) element is optional but encouraged, and the
structure can contain multiple [`<hint>`](./hint)s, [`<answer>`](./answer)s, and
[`<solution>`](./solution)s (in that order).

Other tags which have the
same attributes and structure as the `<example>` tag include:
[`<problem>`](./problem) and [`<question>`](./question).

    <title>Linear Maps</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>P_n(\mathbb R)</m> denote the real vector space of polynomials
        of degree at most <m>n</m>.
        The map <m>T:P_n(\mathbb R) \to P_n(\mathbb R)</m> given by
        <m>T(p) = p'</m>, taking a polynomial to its derivative,
        is a linear map.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        What do you know about how the derivative affects the degree
        of a polynomial and what did you learn in calculus about the
        derivative of a sum of differentiable functions?
      </p>
    </hint>
    <hint>
      <p>
        How about the derivative of a constant times a differentiable function?

  <title>Testing vector space axioms</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Polynomials of degree 3 do not form a vector space.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      The set is not closed under addition and lacks an additive identity.
    </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The sum of elements <m>x^3 + x^2</m> and <m>-x^3 + x</m> equals
      <m>x^2 + x</m> which is not of degree 3,
      so the set is not closed under vector addition.
    </p>
  </solution>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We can also note that the zero polynomial does not have degree 3,
      so is not an element of the set.
    </p>
  </solution>
