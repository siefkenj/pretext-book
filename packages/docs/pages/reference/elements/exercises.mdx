# `<exercises>`

A division containing one or more [`<exercise>`](./exercise.mdx) or 
[`<exercisegroup>`](./exercisegroup.mdx).  Authors often include an `<exercises>` division 
at the end of a [`<chapter>`](./chapter.mdx) or [`<section>`](./section.mdx).

Exercises in an `<exercises>` division have their own numbering counter, and these divisional 
exercises are controlled separately from inline exercises, worksheet exercises, and exercises 
in a [`<reading-questions>`](./reading-questions.mdx) division for things like publisher 
settings and renaming of elements.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="exercises" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <exercises>
        <title>Practice exercises</title>
        <exercise>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m>:
                <me>9x - 2= 4x + 5</me></p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>Add or subtract terms from both sides so that terms with an
                <m>x</m> are on the left side and all other terms are on the
                right.</p>
            </hint>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
            <p>Find the root(s) of <m>x^2= 4</m>.</p>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
            <p>Find any <m>x-</m> intercept(s) of <m>f(x)=x^2+ 1</m>.</p>
