# `<solution>`

The `<solution>` tag is optionally part of a structured [`<example>`](./example)-like, 
[`<project>`](./project)-like, or [`<exercise>`](./exercise).
It contains the details of how to complete the problem, as opposed to a [`<hint>`](./hint) 
or merely the [`<answer>`](./answer).
The visibility and knowling behavior of hints, answers, and solutions can be controlled separately
from the statement of the exercise, example, or project at the document level via the publication file.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="solution" />

## Examples

### An `<example>` structured with statement, hint, answer, and solution

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <example>
        <title>Solve a linear equation</title>
            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m>:
                <me>9x - 2= 4x + 5</me></p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>Add or subtract terms from both sides so that terms with an
                <m>x</m> are on the left side and all other terms are on the
                right.</p>
            </hint>
            <answer>
                <p><m>x = \frac{7}{5}</m></p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
                <p>First, combine the two terms that contain <m>x</m>.
                To do this, we subtract <m>4x</m> from both sides, obtaining.
                <me>5x - 2 = 5</me>.</p>
                <p>Next, we add <m>2</m> to both sides so only the term
                containing <m>x</m> remain on the left-hand side:
                <me>5x = 7</me>.</p>
                <p>Finally, divide both sides by <m>5</m> to get <m>x</m> by
                itself:
                <me>x = \frac{7}{5}</me>.</p>
            </solution>
    </example>

### Solutions can also go on individual tasks of a highly structured project or exercise

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <project>
        <title>Answers on Individual Tasks</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Here is where we give the student the background
                    information required to start accomplishing tasks.

                    <p>
                        A little hint.

                </hint>
                <answer>
                    <p>
                        Just the answer.

                </answer>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        All the glorious details about how to do the first
                        step.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The second step to do.
                        We'll include two solutions.

                <solution>
