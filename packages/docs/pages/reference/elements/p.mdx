# `<p>`

The `<p>` tag represents a paragraph, which can contain text and a wide variety
of inline tags, and functions much like the `<p>` tag in HTML.  This tag is
extremely common and most PreTeXt documents contain many `<p>` tags, because
documents typically contain many paragraphs.

## Syntax

### Attributes

<AttrDisplay name="p" />

### Children

The following elements can be used as children.

<ChildrenDisplay name="p" />

### Child of

This element can appear as an immediate child of the following elements.

<ParentsDisplay name="p" />

## Examples

Our first example shows a paragraph in isolation, containing only plain text,
plus one small math expression and one emphasized word.

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <p>
        Suppose <m>f</m> were a function on the natural numbers.
        That would make some of us <em>very</em> interested in it.
    </p>
</FRAGMENT>
```

But because paragraphs are typically the immediate children of other blocks
(including sections, subsections, theorems, etc.) we also include an example in
which a few paragraphs sit inside a theorem block.

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="subsection section">
    <theorem>
        <p>Many divisions (including theorems, like in this example) can contain
        more than one paragraph in them.</p>
        <p>This one includes three paragraphs, as an example.  I suppose to
        count as a theorem, we should make a mathematical statement, so...</p>
        <p>If <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are the side lengths of a right
        triangle in the Euclidean plane, and <m>c</m> corresponds to the
        hypotenuse, then <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>.</p>
    </theorem>
</FRAGMENT>
```
