# `<rq>`

Right double quote. For those occasional times when you want to close a single quote that wasn't opened,
or close it after some intervening content that can't go inside `<q>`.
Produces the character `&#x2019;` in HTML. Always used with self-closing syntax `<rq/>`.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="rq" />

## Examples
```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    I have a sentence ending with a quote.<rq/>
</FRAGMENT>
```
