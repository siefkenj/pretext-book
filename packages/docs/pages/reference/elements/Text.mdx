# _Text_

_Text_ is usual strings of letters that you might type in any file. There are two
special exceptions to what is considered text, though.

  1. A lone `&` cannot appear in _Text_. Instead, you must type `&amp;` for an ampersand to appear.
  2. A lone `<` cannot appear in _Text_. Instead, you must type `&lt;` for a less-than symbol to appear.

These rules are inherited from the rules of XML.
