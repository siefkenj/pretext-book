# `<title>`

The `<title>` tag is quite ubiquitous within PreTeXt, and appears in three
distinct contexts:  
A `BibTitle` as an immediate child of [`<biblio>`](./biblio);  
a  `LinedTitle` as an immediate child of [`<article>`](./article),
[`<book>`](./book),[`<chapter>`](./chapter), [`<part>`](./part),
[`<section>`](./section);  
or a (generic) `<title>` which appears as a child of many other tags.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="title" />

## Examples

### BibTitles

The title following a [`<biblio>`](./biblio) tag is italicized.

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT>
<backmatter>
    <references>
        <title>References</title>
            <biblio type="raw">Tom Judson,
                <title>Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications</title>.
            </biblio>
    </references>
</backmatter>
</FRAGMENT>
```

### Division, Lined, and generic titles

The title of a division appears not only within the body of the text, but also
as an entry in the Table of Contents and as a label for the browser tab when the corresponding web page is rendered.

When a title is too long for a Table of Contents entry, a
[`<shorttitle>`](./shorttitle) may be provided which will
render more compactly, and a [`<plaintitle>`](./plaintitle) may be given to
provide an even more compact version for the tab in a web browser.
In a PDF version of the document, the [`<plaintitle>`](./plaintitle) is ignored,
but the [`<shorttitle>`](./shorttitle) is honored.

Moreover, when a division title is particularly long, the author may choose to
use a `LinedTitle`, that is using one of more [`<line>`](./line) tags to
specify the manner in which the title should be broken into
separate lines.

Note that division titles do not acquire an trailing period, but the generic title
of say a [`<theorem>`](./theorem) does.


```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT>
<chapter>
    <title>
        <line>A long title will either render</line>
        <line>as a run-on, or as here,</line>
        <line>be broken at specific points</line>
        <line>via <alert>line</alert> tags.</line>
    </title>
    <shorttitle>A shorter title for the TOC</shorttitle>
    <plaintitle>Web page tab title</plaintitle>
    <section>
        <title>
        A section title does not acquire an trailing period
        </title>
        <theorem>
            <title>The title of this theorem acquires a trailing period</title>
            <statement><p><m>2+2=4</m>.</p></statement>
        </theorem>
    </section>
</chapter>
</FRAGMENT>
```
