# `<insight>`

`<insight>` is a [`<remark>`](./remark)-like tag
and so shares the attributes and structure with other remark-like tags.
In particular, the `<insight>` tag creates a container for an
insightful statement with optional [`<title>`](./title)
and [`<idx>`](./idx).

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="insight" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="section subsection">
<insight>
    <title>Pivot columns</title>
    <p>
        When we consider a linear system of the form <m>Ax=b</m>,
        we know (via Gaussian elimination) that the system is solvable if
        and only if the rightmost column of the augmented matrix <m>[A|b]</m>
        is not a pivot column, which is to say that the reduced
        row-echelon form of the augmented matrix does not have a row of the form
        <m>[0\ 0 \dots 0\ *]</m> where <m>*</m> is a nonzero scalar.
    </p>
</insight>
</FRAGMENT>
