# `<remark>`

The `<remark>` tag creates a container for a remark
with optional [`<title>`](./title) and
[`<idx>`](./idx), followed by a mixture of [`<p>`](./p),
[`<blockquote>`](./blockquote), and [`<pre>`](./pre).

The structure of the `remark` tag is completely
analogous to that of the following tags: [`<convention>`](./convention),
[`<insight>`](./insight), [`<note>`](./note), [`<observation>`](./observation),
and [`<warning>`](./warning).


## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="remark" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="section subsection">
<remark>
    <title>Eigenvectors and kernels</title>
    <p>
    Given a linear map <m>T:V \to V</m> on a vector space <m>V</m> over a field
    <m>F</m>, an eigenvalue is a scalar <m>\lambda\in F</m> for which there exists
    a nonzero vector <m>v\in V</m> (an eigenvector) for which
    <m>T(v) = \lambda v</m>. At first blush this may seem an odd notion,
    but it becomes less so when we observe that eigenvalues are defined to be those
    scalars <m>\lambda\in F</m> for which <m>\ker(T-\lambda I_V) \ne 0.</m>
    </p>
</remark>
</FRAGMENT>
