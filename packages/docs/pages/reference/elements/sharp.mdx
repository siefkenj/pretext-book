# `<sharp>`

The self-closing `<sharp/>` tag displays the sharp symbol in music notation. 

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="sharp" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    <p>
    In the context of music, the sharp symbol (<sharp/>) can be used to specify key signatures
    or to modify a single note.  It raises the pitch (of a note) by one semitone. 
    </p>
     
    <p> 
    This contrasts with the flat symbol (<flat/>) which lowers the pitch by one semitone, thus
    A<sharp/> has the same pitch as a B<flat/>.
    </p>

    <p> In some settings, the sharp is written as a superscript, such as
    <n pc="A" acc="sharp" />, written <c>&lt;n pc="A" acc="sharp" /&gt;</c>.
    </p>

    <p> 
    Finally, we mention the programming language F#, pronounced F-sharp despite the use of 
    the number/hashtag # instead of a sharp <sharp/>.
    </p>
