# `<sharp>`

The self-closing `<sharp/>` tag displays the sharp symbol in music notation. 

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="sharp" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    In the context of music, the sharp symbol (<sharp/>) can be used in specifying key signatures or in modifying a single note.  It raises the pitch (of a note) by one semitone.  This contrasts with the flat symbol (<flat/>) which lowers the pitch by one semitone, thus
    A<sharp/> has the same pitch as a B<flat/>.
