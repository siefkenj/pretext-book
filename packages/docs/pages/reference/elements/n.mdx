# `<n>`

The self-closing `<n/>` tag displays detailed symbol about a musical note.
## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="n" />

## Examples

 
```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    The &lt;n/&gt; tag is a compact way in which to convey detailed information about a musical 
    note.  For example, "play the note C on a standard keyboard" does not provide enough 
    information as it lacks the octave in which the C occurs.

  "Middle C" is the fourth C on the 88-key paino keyboard denoted <n pc="C" octave="4"/>. One
    denotes a C<sharp/> in the same octave as <n pc="C" acc="sharp" octave="4" />, written in 
    PreTeXt as <c>&lt; n pc="C" acc="sharp" octave="4" /&gt; </c>.
