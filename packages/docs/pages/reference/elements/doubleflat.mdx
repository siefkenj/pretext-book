# `<doubleflat>`

The self-closing `<doubleflat/>` tag displays the doubleflat symbol in music notation.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="doubleflat" />

## Examples

 ```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    In the context of music, the doubleflat symbol (<doubleflat/>) is most often used as a natural modifying a single note, typically to flaten a note which is already flatened in the key signature. It lowers the pitch (of a note) by two semitones, that is a whole tone (in Western music).  This contrasts with the doublesharp symbol (<doublesharp/>) which raises the pitch by two semitones, thus
    B<doubleflat/> has the same pitch as an A: (B -> B<flat\>=A<\sharp> -> A).
