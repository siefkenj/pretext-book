# `<doubleflat>`

The self-closing `<doubleflat/>` tag displays the doubleflat symbol in music notation. 

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="doubleflat" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    <p>
    In the context of music, the doubleflat symbol (<doubleflat/>) can be used to modify a single
    note.  It lowers the pitch of the note by two semitones. Thus B<doubleflat/> has the same pitch 
    as an A. Often when a key signature already specifies a note be flattened, the doubleflat simply
    indicates that it should be flattened beyond what is specified by the key signature.
