# `<reading-questions>`

A division containing one or more [`<exercise>`](./exercise.mdx) whose purpose is to ascertain
understanding of the preceding material.  Authors might include a `<reading-questions>` division 
after exposition but before material intended for during class or after class practice.  

Similar to an [`<exercises>`](./exercises.mdx) division but differing in intended purpose and some 
allowed content. Exercises in `<reading-questions>` have their own numbering counter and are 
controlled separately from divisional exercises, inline exercises, and worksheet exercises for 
things like publisher settings and renaming of elements.
