# `<author>`

The `<author>` tag can be used in four distinct cases:

1. In the [`<frontmatter>`](./frontmatter) as a child of [`<bibinfo>`](./bibinfo), the tag is used to provide information about the author of the document.  It is structured with [`<personname>`](./personname) as well as further information about the author, including their [`<institution>`](./institution), [`<department>`](./department), and [`<email>`](./email).
2. When put at the beginning of a chapter, section, or other division, the tag contains just text to credit who the division was written by.
3. The tag is also used as part of a bibliographic entry.
4. The tag is used to give the author of a poem when included in a [`<poem>`] element.
