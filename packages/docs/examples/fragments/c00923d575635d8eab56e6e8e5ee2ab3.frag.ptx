    <theorem>
        <p>Many divisions (including theorems, like in this example) can contain
        more than one paragraph in them.</p>
        <p>This one includes three paragraphs, as an example.  I suppose to
        count as a theorem, we should make a mathematical statement, so...</p>
        <p>If <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are the side lengths of a right
        triangle in the Euclidean plane, and <m>c</m> corresponds to the
        hypotenuse, then <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>.</p>
