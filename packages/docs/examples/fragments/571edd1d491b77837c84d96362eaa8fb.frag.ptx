            <statement>
                <p>Solve for <m>x</m>:
                <me>9x - 2= 4x + 5</me></p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>Add or subtract terms from both sides so that terms with an
                <m>x</m> are on the left side and all other terms are on the
                right.</p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
                <p>First, combine the two terms that contain <m>x</m>.
                To do this, we subtract <m>4x</m> from both sides, obtaining.
                <me>5x - 2 = 5</me>.</p>
                <p>Next, we add <m>2</m> to both sides so only the term
                containing <m>x</m> remain on the left-hand side:
                <me>5x = 7</me>.</p>
                <p>Finally, divide both sides by <m>5</m> to get <m>x</m> by
                itself:
                <me>x = \frac{7}{5}</me>.</p>
            </solution>
            <answer>
                <p><m>x = \frac{7}{5}</m></p>
            </answer>
