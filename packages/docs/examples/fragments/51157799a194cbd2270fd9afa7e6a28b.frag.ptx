Given an <m>m\times n</m> real matrix <m>A,</m> show that
there exist (appropriately sized) elementary matrices
<m>U,V</m> so that <m>UAV</m> has the form <me>UAV =
\begin{bmatrix} I_r\amp \mathbf 0\\ \mathbf 0\amp\mathbf
0 \end{bmatrix}.</me> where <m>I_r</m> is the <m>r\times
r</m> identity matrix, <m>r</m> the rank of <m>A</m>,
and the other entries are all zeros.

<p>
    Note that when we work with modules over a PID instead of
    vector spaces over a field, this construct leads to a
    diagonal matrix called the
    <term>Smith normal form</term> of the matrix <m>A.</m>
</p>
<p>
    The nonzero diagonal elements of the Smith normal form are
    called the <term>invariant factors</term>.
